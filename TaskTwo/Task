You are given a list of cities. Each direct connection between two cities has its
transportation cost (an integer bigger than 0). The goal is to find the paths of 
minimum cost between pairs of cities. Assume that the cost of each path (which is the
sum of costs of all direct connections belongning to this path) is at most 200000. The
name of a city is a string containing characters a,...,z and is at most 10 characters long.2)
